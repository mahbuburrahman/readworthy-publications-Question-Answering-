Few sentences:
Antoine et al.,2014, presented a subgraph embedding question answering model based on knowledgebase for a variety of topics. 

Summery:
According to this system, it has access to a set of training question-answer pairs and a KB providing structures
among answers. It is supposed that KB has all potential answers and sequences of words of a question as one identified KB entity. 
If any entity is not given for a question, plain string matching is used to perform entity resolution. 

This system uses WebQuestions, a developed subset from Freebase and ClueWeb extractions and a paraphrasing version of WikiAnswers.



Knowledge from this paper:
Open QA systesms can be of two main types. First one is information retrieval based QA system and the second one is semantic
parsing based QA system. 
In the first one, initially a question is transformed into a query and then a broad set of candidate answers are retrieved 
by searching from kbs based on the generated query. Then the extact answer is selected using different heuristics. [Example 
Xuchen Yao and Benjamin Van Durme. 2014. Information extraction over structured data: Question answering with freebase. 
In Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the ACL]

In the second case, it tries to get the correct interpretation of a question using semantic similarity based systems and then 
transforms a question into a database query which returns the correct answer. [Example Anthony Fader, Luke Zettlemoyer, 
and Oren Etzioni. 2013. Paraphrase-driven learning for open question answering. In Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting
of the Association for Computational Linguis- tics, pages 1608–1618, Sofia, Bulgaria.]
