Few sentences:
This paper presents approache to retrieve relevant biomedical articles that can answer questions related to multiple categories
of clinical information needs.

Summery:
It has three main processes.
1. Topical Keyword Extraction: extraction of ontologybased topical keywords.
The Keywords which represents specific topic in the area. That means topic description. 

2. Knowledge-based Clinical Inferencing: use of topical keywords as queries to a third-party clinical knowledge base and
extraction of a ranked list of inferred diagnoses/tests/treatments corresponding to each given topic

3. Biomedical Literature Retrieval: retrieval and ranking of pertinent biomedical articles based on the keywords,
concepts, and the ranked list of inferred diagnoses/tests/ treatments extracted in the prior steps.

Dataset: PubMed 
KB: From Wikipedia

Knowledge from this paper:
1. We can generate topical keywords from an RFP using different topic modeling algorithm.
2. Then we can develop a knowledgebase from RFP domain where each of the entry will represent an inference or concept. It may
be some answer pattern from RFP. 
For example
When is due?
The due is July 30, 2015.
So it may be some relations (Subject. predicate, object)
Then we can map our topical keywork in the relationships to retrive a list of relevant cocenpts or answer relationship
3. Then we can search same pattern from the test RFP for getting relevant sentences which mach with retrieved cocenpts.
