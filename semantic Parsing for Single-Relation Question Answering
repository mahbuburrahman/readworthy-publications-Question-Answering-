Summery:

They develop a semantic parsing framework based on semantic similarity for open question answering. They focus on single 
relation factual questions and decompose each question into an entity mention and a relation pattern. They use convolutional
neural network models to measure the similarity of entity mentions with entities and relation pattern with relation in the
knowledge base (KB).  

A single relation question is defined as a question composed of an entity mention and a binary relation description where the 
answer  to the question is the naother entity for the given relation in the question.

Example of Single relation factual question: Who is the CEO of Tesla? 

Enrity mention: Tesla
Reation : is_the_CEO
Answer: another entity from KB

And a knowledgebase is viewed as a collection of binary relation instances in the form of r(e1,e2) where e1 and e2 are
first and second arguments of relation r.


They develop to semantic similarity models:
One : Linking entity mention from question to entity in KB.
Another one: Maps a relation pattern to a relation in KB.
Answer is derived by finding the relation-entity triple r(e1,e2) in the KB and returning the missing entity from the question. 


They didn't handle multi-relation questions.

Dataset: 
PARALAX dataset : paraphrases of questions mined from wikianswers and answer triples are from reverb.
