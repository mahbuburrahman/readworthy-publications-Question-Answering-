Few sentences:



Summery:
They consider KB as a interlined collection of topics. When a question is given on one or more topics, they collect all involved
topics as a related node within few hops of relation to the topic node to extract answer. They called this a topic graph and they 
assume that answer can be found within this graph. This graph is formed form freebase graph. They do this by mapping relation 
arguments triples to freebase relation triples.

They mine ClueWeb for mapping relations. The ClueWeb dataset is a collection of 1 billion webpages. FACCI , the Freebase 
Annotation of the ClueWeb Corpus version 1  contains index and offset of Freebase entities within the English portion 
of ClueWeb.  



They use Google Suggestion service to get questions commonly asked by users. 


They generate a question graphs based on following information from a  question by using dependency parse.
Question word (what), question focus(cue to expected answer, name), question verb(is, play), question topic(NER) 

To get the most likely relation from a question they calculate, given a question Q of a word vector w, they want to find
out the relation R that maximizes the probability P (R | Q). They use naive bayes rules for this .

Knowledge from this paper:
IE communities try to get answer for question by performing relatively coarse information retrival as a way to triage the
set of possible answer candidtaes and then attemp to do deeper analysis.
